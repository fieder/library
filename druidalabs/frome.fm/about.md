# Transition - where are we going

The way people consume radio these days is shifting to a new paradigm. People tend to consume customised content on demand, rather than tunning into radio programs at specific times and dates like it used to be.

With the advent of internet and devices able to consume multimedia we believe that the radio experience could be way richer than just listening to an audio in a given dial. 

We want to run the radio as a transparent open source project maintained by its contributors so it never dies or gets developer/vendor locked-in.

By using this innovative approach we believe we can serve content faster, cheaper and in a more secure way to our audience. 

[Frome FM](https://github.com/druidalabs/frome.fm) is free to use open source Jekyll project based on [Evento's Jekill template](https://github.com/boyney123/evento)

Come and join us to re-shape the radio industry!
